# Automatic-Speerdrun-Assistant

This is the automatic speedrun assistant repository. The goal of this project is to allow people who are speedrunning retro games to easily time their runs. The way we will achieve this is by making a program that reads certain data from a game's rom (e.g. a Super Mario World ROM) to know when to start and stop a timer for the correct times. This could be very helpful for speedrunners to be more percise with their timing, and will make it easier for them as the timer would automatically start/stop at the speedrun-legal times, so their run would be considered valid.

However, as of now, we don't have anything coded yet. If anyone knows how to contribute to this project, feel free to create a pull request to show off some Proof Of Concept code for this project, or start a discussion through an issue if you need to share any thoughts on how we can improve this project.
